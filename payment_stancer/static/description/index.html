  <h3>Accept a multitude of payment methods</h3>
  <p>
    The Stancer module for Odoo allows you to accept the most common payment methods used by your customers such
    as credit cards, classic or instant SEPA transfers, or SEPA direct debits, to collect them from
    your Odoo merchant site.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to make the shopping experience smoother, customers have the possibility to register a credit card
    during the checkout process in order to quickly pay their next purchases.
  </p>

    available:

  <ol>
    <li>
      Via a Stancer integrated iframe on your merchant site: When the customer clicks on <q>Order</q>, the Stancer
      payment module iframe opens on the page of your site and allows the customer to enter their bank details.
    </li>
    <li>
      Via a redirection: After clicking on <q>Checkout</q>, the user automatically leaves your merchant site
      and is directed to a Stancer payment page. Once the payment has been accepted, the user is redirected to
